## Conclusion

For a real-world web app, it is common to allow users to access basic features (such as playing quizzes and discovering content) without verification. However, actions that impact the app's integrity or involve deeper user interaction (such as creating quizzes, rating content, and bookmarking) should be restricted to verified accounts. This creates a balance between user convenience and maintaining app security.
